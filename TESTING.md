# Testing Guide for AI Story Automation Tool

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for testing the AI Story Automation Tool, ensuring code quality, reliability, and performance.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- pip
- virtualenv (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gwagwa42/ai-story-automation-tool.git
cd ai-story-automation-tool
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-mock coverage
```

## Running Tests

### Basic Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v tests/

# Run tests for a specific module
pytest tests/scraping/
```

### Coverage Report

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report -m
coverage html  # Generate HTML report
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Validate individual component functionality
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Ensure each function works as expected

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test interactions between components
- Validate system-wide workflows
- Ensure modules work together seamlessly

### 3. Performance Tests
- Measure execution time
- Check resource utilization
- Validate scalability

## Specific Module Testing

### Web Scraping Module

#### Tested Scenarios
- Spider configuration validation
- Content extraction
- Relevance scoring
- Error handling
- Concurrent discovery

#### Running Web Scraping Tests
```bash
pytest tests/scraping/
```

### Continuous Integration

#### GitHub Actions
A CI pipeline is configured to:
- Run tests on multiple Python versions
- Check code coverage
- Validate code quality

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests
- Cover both successful and failure scenarios
- Use mock objects for external dependencies
- Ensure high code coverage
- Test edge cases

### Mocking External Services
```python
# Example of mocking web requests
def test_web_scraping(mocker):
    mock_response = mocker.Mock()
    mock_response.text = "Mocked content"
    mocker.patch('requests.get', return_value=mock_response)
```

## Performance Targets

- Unit Test Coverage: >90%
- Integration Test Coverage: >85%
- Maximum Test Execution Time: <5 minutes
- Branches Covered: >90%

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Check Python and package versions
- Verify network connections for web-based tests

### Debugging
```bash
# Verbose test output
pytest -vv --tb=long

# Stop on first failure
pytest -x
```

## Contributing

1. Write tests for new features
2. Ensure 100% coverage for new code
3. Run full test suite before submitting PRs
4. Use type hints and docstrings

## Tools and Libraries

- pytest: Test framework
- pytest-asyncio: Async test support
- pytest-mock: Mocking utilities
- coverage: Code coverage analysis

## Ethical Testing Considerations

- Respect web scraping ethics
- Use mock data for external services
- Avoid unnecessary network requests
- Implement rate limiting in tests

## Advanced Testing

### Load and Stress Testing
- Simulate high-concurrency scenarios
- Test with large datasets
- Measure system performance limits
